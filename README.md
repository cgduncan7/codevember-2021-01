30 days, 30 creative experiments. CodeVember is a challenge for developers creating a creative sketch by day during the whole month of November.

## Description
This is a template repo for my codevember sketches. It is setup to use the latest version of p5js in instanced mode. Works great with static hosting in github pages :sunglasses:
